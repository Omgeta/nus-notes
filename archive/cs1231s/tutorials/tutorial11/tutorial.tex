        \item Suppose $G = (V, E)$ is a connected, simple, undirected graph
        \item There is spanning tree $T = (V, E')$, where $E' \subseteq E$\hfill(Proposition 10.7.1)
        \item Since $T$ is a tree, $|E'| = |V| - 1$\hfill(Theorem 10.5.2)

        \begin{enumproof}
        \item Suppose $G = (V, E)$ is an acyclic, simple, undirected graph
        \item Take all complete subgraphs of $G$, $H_1(V_1, E_1), \cdots, H_n(V_n, E_n)$ which also form trees

        \item $|E| = |E_1| + \cdots + |E_n| = |V| - n$

    \item Prove $G$ is tree $\rightarrow$ there is exactly one path between every pair of vertices:

      \item Suppose $G = (V, E)$ is a tree
      \item $G$ is connected and acyclic\hfill(Definition of tree)
      \item Any two vertices have a path between them\hfill(Definition of connected)
      \item Suppose there are vertices with two or more paths connecting them:
      \begin{enumproof}
        \item Then, $G$ is cyclic\hfill(Lemma 10.5.5)
        \item This contradicts 1.2
      \end{enumproof}
      \item Hence, the supposition is false, and there is exactly one path between every pair of vectors

    \item Prove there is exactly one path between every pair of vertices $\rightarrow$ $G$ is a tree:
      \begin{enumproof}
      \item Suppose $G = (V, E)$ is a graph with exactly one path between every pair of vertices
      \item $G$ is connected\hfill(Definition of connected)
      \item Suppose $G$ is cyclic:
        \begin{enumproof}
        \item There is a cycle $C$ in $G$\hfill(Definition of cyclic)
        \item Any two vertices in $C$ have two paths connecting them
        \item This contradicts 2.1
        \end{enumproof}
      \item Hence, the supposition is false, and $G$ is acyclic
      \item $G$ is a tree\hfill(Definition of tree)
      \end{enumproof}
    \item $\therefore$ $G$ is a tree $\iff$ there is exactly one path between every pair of vectors$\qed$

  \item 
    \begin{enumproof}
      \item Suppose $G = (V, E)$ is a graph where each complete subgraph is a group of stones
      \item Initially, we have $K_n$ which has $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ edges
      \item With each splitting into complete subgraphs of $k_1, k_2$ vertices, we remove $k_1\times k_2$ edges
      \item Finally, we stop when there are exactly $n$ subgraphs, each with $1$ vertex with no edges
      \item At this point, we will have removed all $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ edges, which is also the maximum earnt $\qed$

      \item Yes; rule 1 and rule 3 

      \item Minimum height: $O(\log_an) + 1$. Maximum height: $O(\log_bn)$

      \item We can use an array of (key, subtree) pairs. 

      \item $O(\log_an \cdot \log b) = O(\log_an) = O(\log n)$ 

      \item Internal node: $\{5, 6, 7, 8\}$ splits at median $6$ which is moved to the parent\\
        Root node: $\{10, 20, 30\}$ splits at median $20$ which is the new root

      \item Nodes split proactively at $b-1$ keys so each split child meets $a-1$ minimum.\\
        After splitting, the leaf has $< b-1$ keys allowing safe insertion
        This preserves leaf depth and key ranges.

      \item $O(\log n)$ as splits can propagate 

      \item Merge: $\{5\}, \{7, 8\}$ split by $6$ becomes $\{5, 6, 7, 8\}$\\
        Share: $\{5, 6\}, \{8\}$ split by $7$ becomes $\{5, 6, 7, 8\}$ and splits back into $\{5\}, \{7, 8\}$ split by $6$
        $O(\log n)$ as merges and shares propagate up.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*.)]
      \item $\frac{n}{B}$

      \item $\log(\frac{n}{B})$

      \item All $O(1)$

      \item $O(\log_Bn)$

  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*.)]
      \item Create nodes where the key is height (double), and values are name (string) and grade (double) 

      \item Use an AVL tree to maintain a balanced BST. Augment with the sum of grades in each subtree. 

      \item Modify each node with a list of student information.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*.)]
      \item Use an AVL tree where the nodes are inserted with the initial flip state and the key is their index. Augment each node with a lazy flag indicated that the nodes in the subtree should be flipped. Now, $turnOver$ just finds the subtree root node in $O(\log n)$ and toggles the lazy flip flag. When the actual flip state of the card is evaluated, just trace the number of flips along the path to the node.

\begin{enumerate}[Q\arabic*.]
  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*)]
      \item $[26, 0, 19, 2, 0, 5, 12]$ 

      \item $[26, 0, 19, 2, 0, X, X]$ 

      \item $[A, B, 0]$
    \end{enumerate}

  \item HashMap storing counts, elements with count $2$ are intersection, all elements in the HashMap are union. Time: $O(|A| + |B|)$

  \item Naive: iterate through each subarray starting with $i$, returning true if running average is $k$.\\
    Efficient: subtract $k$ from each element and calculate the prefix-sum (i.e. find complement array), then any duplicates indicate subarray found.

  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*.)]
    
      \item QuickSelect in $O(n)$

      \item Maintain a MinHeap of $n-k$ elements, if the next element is lesser than the min element (i.e. kth largest), then discard it, else add the previous min and swap the next into the minHeap head 
    \end{enumerate}

  \item
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*.)]
      \item $push$: push to stack 1\\
        $pop$: pop from stack 2, if stack 2 is empty pop all elements from stack 1 and transfer to stack 2

      \item $push$: worst-case and amortized $O(t)$\\
        $pop$: worst-case $O(n)$ when transferring elements, amortized $O(s)$
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Same as Q5, but in each node, store the minimum of the existing elements. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[Q\arabic*.]
  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*.)]
      \item Graph with negative weights.

      \item Trees (BFS is $O(V+E)$), DAGs (Topo sort is $O(V+E)$) 
    \end{enumerate}

  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*.)]
      \item Modify the relax, convering the addition to a multiplication, relax if result is longer rather than shorter

      \item Set edge weights to $\log f_e$
    \end{enumerate}

  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*.)]
      \item $lp(u) = max_{v\in N(u)}[lp(v)]+1$ 

      \item Post-order DFS is $O(V+E)$

      \item Toposort and compute $lp(u)$ in reverse toposort order. We can store each $lp(u)$ in an array/hashtable for memoization.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Two DAGs, one with uphill directed edges, and another with downhill directed edges. Connect nodes from uphill to downhill DAG if an edge originally existed between them.

  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*.)]
      \item Pre-compute shortest paths to and from all nodes, then find the maximum edge where the sum of edges $\leq D$

      \item Duplicate the graph twice to force a graph to go through two transient edges, where the transient edges based on binary search for edge lengths.
    \end{enumerate}

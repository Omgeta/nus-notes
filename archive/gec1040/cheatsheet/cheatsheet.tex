\section{Unsustainable Development}
Unsustainable development harms the ability of future generations to meet their needs due to the degradation of our climate, life-support systems and resources.
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Global Environmental Indicators: Planetary boundaries have already been exceeded (climate change, biodiversity loss, nitrogen cycle).
  \item Stability Landscape: Ecosystems may lose resilience - once thresholds are crossed (valley basins), systems may not return to their original state.
  \item Changing Climate: We are living in a changing climate. We need to mitigate impacts on us and ecosystem, or otherwise become more adaptable
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Ecological Footprint}

Terminology:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Bioproductivity: amount and rate of production occuring in an ecosystem over a period of time.
  \item Biocapacity $=$ Area $\times$ Biocapacity: quantifies nature's capacity to produce renewable resources, provide land for built-up areas and provide waste absorption services such as carbon uptake.
  \item Ecological Footprint (gha) $=$ Population $\times$ Consumption/Person $\times$ Footprint Intensity: quantifies biological productive area needed for provision of renewable resources, or require absorption of $\text{CO}_2$ waste.
  \item Footprint and biocapacity can be ranked by countries, enabling them to learn from each other. 
  \item Ecological Deficit: ecological footprint$>$biocapacity (currently exceeded by 50\%).
\end{enumerate}

Earth Overshoot Day is the date when annual footprint exceeds annual biocapacity:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Occurs earlier each year (first at 1970)
  \item COVID-19 caused ecological footprint to contract
  \item \#MoveTheDate: push overshoot to December via sustainable cities, resilient systems, etc.
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{-1em}
\colbreak
\subsection{Causes}
Overpopulation due to exponential population growth:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item 8.1b (2025) $\rightarrow$ 9.5b (2050) $\rightarrow$ 11b (2100) 
  \item Pressure on land, soil degredation, and biodiversity 
  \item Prior to Industrial Revolution, growth was resource-limited but now largely unchecked 
  \item Various demands by billions for a comfortable life, but everyone should have the equal right to health 
\end{enumerate}

Unsustainable Resource Use:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Affluenza: oversumption in affluent societies
  \item Developing countries fixated on GDP as sole success metric ignoring environmental costs
\end{enumerate}

Poverty links to environment in a downward spiral:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Direct reliance on food, water, fuel for survival
  \item Degenerate forests, soil, grasslands and wildlife causing environmental degradation
  \item Degraded environment further impoverishes people
\end{enumerate}

Excluding Environmental Costs:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Market prices ignore externalities such as ecosystem loss, health impacts and pollution 
  \item Ex. Timber companies pay to clear forests but not for environmental degradation and loss of habitat 
  \item Ex. Fishing companies pay to catch fish but not for depletion of fish stocks 
  \item Taxes and fines aim to fix this but not enough
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Tragedy of the Commons}

Tragedy of the commons is the overuse of a common property or free-access resource causing depletion for all.
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Mentality of "If I do not use it, someone else will. The little bit I use or pollute doesn't matter".
  \item Solutions:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Responsible usage of shared renewed resources at rates well below sustainable yields
      \item Convert open-access renewable resources to private ownership
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsubsection{IPAT Model}
IPAT quantifies environmental impact as $I = P \times A \times T$
where $P$ is population, $A$ is affluence, $T$ is technology:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Population: not dominant factor 
  \item Affluence: $\displaystyle\frac{\text{Goods \& Services}}{\text{Person}}$ can harm through high consumption, pollution and resource wastage but also produce funding for innovative R\&D (e.g. Denmark, India's ethanol-blended gasoline)
  \item Technology: $\displaystyle\frac{\text{Impact}}{\text{Goods \& Services}}$ reduces impact 
  \item Ex.: Gasoline = cars $\times$ miles/car $\times$ gasoline/mile
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Pollution}
Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that adversely affects a resource. 
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Point Source: single, identifiable source (e.g. smokestack, drainpipes)
  \item Nonpoint Source: dispersed and difficult to identify (e.g. fertilizer and pesticide runoff into lakes - first flush effect after dryspell)
\end{enumerate}

Health Effects:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Headache and Fatigue
  \item Respiratory Illness
  \item Cardiovascular Illness
  \item Cancer Risk
  \item Nausea and Gastroenteritis
  \item Skin Irritation
\end{enumerate}

Management Methods:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Cleanup (end-of-pipe): clean/dillute contaminants
    \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, label=$-$]\vspace{1pt}
      \item Temporary; growth in consumption may offset pollution control tech
      \item Often relocates pollutants to another area 
      \item Costly to clean dispersed pollutants
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Prevention (front-of-pipe): reduce/stop production
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsection{Environmental Viewpoints}
Planetary Management:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item View: We are apart from the rest of nature and can manage it to meet our increasing demands.
  \item Resources: We will not run out, due to our ingenuity and technology.
  \item Economy: Potential for economic growth is essentially unlimited.
  \item Success: Depends on how well we manage the earth's life-support systems for our benefit.
\end{enumerate}

Stewardship:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item View: We have an ethical responsibility to be caring stewards of the earth.
  \item Resources: We will probably not run out, but they should not be wasted.
  \item Economy: Encourage environmentally friendly economic growth and discourage harmful forms.
  \item Success: Depends on our managing the earth's life-support systems for our and nature's benefit. 
\end{enumerate}

Environmental Wisdom:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item View: We are part of and totally dependent on nature, and nature exists for all species. 
  \item Resources: Limited and should not be wasted.
  \item Economy: Encourage earth-sustaining economic growth and discourage earth-degrading forms.
  \item Success: Depends on learning how nature sustains itself, integrating them into how we think and act.
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\section{Principles and Practical Applications of Sustainability}
Environmentally sustainable societies meet present needs without compromising future generations' own needs:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Without destroying the environment
  \item Without endangering the future welfare of the planet and its people 
  \item In a just and equitable manner
\end{enumerate}

Sustainability is the ability of Earth's natural systems, cultural systems and economies to survive and adapt to changing environmental conditions indefinitely. 3 Pillars:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Environment (ecological integrity)
  \item Economy (economic viability)
  \item Society (equity)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)}

UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted in 2015 by 2500 scientists from 190 nations, providing a global framework to steer towards a safe and just operating space for society to thrive in until 2030:
\begin{enumerate}[\arabic*.]
  \item No Poverty

  \item Partnerships to achieve the Goal
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{-1em}
\colbreak
\subsubsection{International Spillovers}
Spillovers are transboundary negative impacts generated by one country on others, which can undermine their ability to achieve the SDGs, measured by Spillover Score. Types of spillovers:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Environmental: use of natural resources and pollution, including transboundary effects embodied in trade, and direct cross-border flows in air and water
  \item Economic/Financial/Governance: international development finance, unfair tax competition, banking secrecy, and labor standards
  \item Security: negative externalities such as arms trade and organized crime destabilizing poorer countries; positive spillovers include conflict-prevention and peacekeeping investments
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Natural Capital}
Natural capital (natural resources $+$ natural services) refers to the stock of natural resources and ecosystem services that sustain human life :  
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Natural Resources: includes air, water, soil, land, life (biodiversity), nonrenewable resources, renewable energy and nonrenewable energy
  \item Natural Services: includes air purification, water purification, water storage, soil renewal, nutrient recycling, food production, conservation of biodiversity, wildlife habitat, forest renewal, waste treatment, climate control, population control and pest control
  \item Degradation of natural capital undermines long-term sustainability
  \item Preserving natural capital is essential for intergenerational equity
\end{enumerate}

  \item Smart Energy Grid: real-time data management optimisation saves 1,700 tonnes CO$_2$ annually; rooftop PV panels generate 3,000 MWh annually
  \item Open Digital Platform (ODP): collect and analyse environmental and building data to improve energy efficiency, reduce costs and minimise impact
  \item Digital Twin: real-time planning-simulation model
  \item Centralised Cooling System: cooling towers with underground distribution reduce energy use by $30\%$ and 3,700--4,000 tonnes CO$_2$ annually
  \item Carlite District: prioritises low-emission transport
\end{enumerate}

Future:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Environmental Modelling
  \item Use of recycled materials for construction
  \item Fuel Cell System for Lifts 
  \item Regenerative Lift converts motions into energy

  \item "Develop an eco-town with a human settlement that enables its residents to live a
good quality of life while using minimal natural resources."
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsection{Case Study: Singapore Story}
Vision of "Clean, Green and Good Living Environment" for present and future generations, balancing economic development, social progress and environmental protection (strong commitment from the top).

Fundamental Principles:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Control pollution at source
  \item "Polluter Pays" principle
  \item Pre-empt and take early action
  \item Innovation and technology
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Ex. Semakau Landfill as first man-made offshore landfill, Ulu Pandan NEWater Plant
    \end{itemize}
  \item Resource conservation 
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Ex. Waste recycling, energy efficient energy 
    \end{itemize}
  \item Environmental ownership
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{3pt}
      \item Ex. Involvment of 3P (private, pubic, people) with communication, engagement and empowerment
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Key Strategies:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Integrated land-use planning and development control (e.g., Singapore River clean-up)
  \item Environmental infrastructure (e.g., integrated solid waste; water and wastewater treatment)
  \item Environmental legislation and enforcement (pragmatic, progressive controls)
  \item Environmental monitoring (assess level of pollution, track trends, inform standards and planning)
  \item Environmental education (instil awareness via campaigns, training, dialogues)
\end{enumerate}

Future Challenges:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Small tropical island, high population density, limited natural resources
  \item Rising consumerism and environmental expectations; need to sustain standards
\end{enumerate}
\colbreak
\section{Circular Economy}
Circular economy is a regenerative system where resource input, waste, emissions, and energy leakage are minimised by slowing, closing, and narrowing resource loops.  
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Replaces the end-of-life concept with long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling
  \item Regenerate natural systems by returning valuable nutrients to ecosystems
  \item Supports economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainable development
  \item Mimics nature's cyclical systems 
\end{enumerate}

Economy Progression:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Linear Economy: take $\rightarrow$ make $\rightarrow$ dispose (single-use, wasteful)
  \item Recycling Economy: partial recovery through recycling but still wasteful
  \item Circular Economy: design for closed loops, resources kept in circulation, waste designed out
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Energy and Matter}

High-quality energy is concentrated, good for useful work.
Low-quality energy is dispersed, bad for useful work.

Three Big Ideas:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item There is no "away": matter cannot be destroyed, only converted\hfill(Law of Conservation)
  \item Cannot get something for nothing; cannot get out more energy than in\hfill(1st Law of Thermodynamics)
  \item Cannot break even; energy conversion from one form to another reduces energy quality or less usable energy\hfill(2nd Law of Thermodynamics)
\end{enumerate}

Economy Types:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item High-throughput economy: unsustainable, high-waste, promotes pollution
  \item Low-throughput economy: matter-recycling and reuse; mimics nature and reduces pollutants but may be insufficient for growing populations
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsection{Industrial Symbiosis}

Industrial symbiosis is a business relationship focused on sharing resources between industrial facilities/companies where wastes or byproducts from one become raw materials for another.
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Subset of Industrial Ecology: shift from linear to cyclical (closed-loop) systems
  \item Mutually beneficial cooperation which reduces environmental impact while improving business competitiveness
  \item Key enabling business model for advancing the move to a circular economy
  \item Ex. Kalundborg, Denmark: cooperation among 8 industries sharing energy, water, and materials 

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Applications and Innovations}
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Bioplastics: key enabler of low-carbon circular economy; allow closed resource cycles and cascading reuse especially when being reused or recycled
  \item Design for longevity: durability, easy repair, remanufacturing
  \item Closed resource cycles: minimize virgin resource extraction via reuse and recovery
  \item Resource Recovery: convert waste streams into valuable resources (e.g., waste-to-energy, nutrient recovery, material cascading)
\end{enumerate}
\colbreak

\section{Sustainable Urbanization}

Urbanization is inevitable as societies advance, but it poses significant environmental and social challenges. Sustainable cities aim to balance growth with ecological integrity, equity, and efficiency.  
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item $>50\%$ of the world's population lives in cities, with further growth projected esp. developing countries
  \item Urban living $\rightarrow$ higher literacy, education, health, social services, cultural and political participation.
  \item Trends:\vspace{2pt}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
      \item Proportion of urban global population growing
      \item Number and sizes of urban areas mushrooming
      \item Rapid increase in urban populations in developing countries
      \item Urban growth slower in developed nations
      \item Increasing poverty and inequality (75\% of cities more unequal now than 20 years ago)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Disadvantages of Urbanization:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Unsustainable systems
  \item Lack of vegetation
  \item Water problems 
  \item Pollution and health problems 
  \item Noise pollution 
  \item Climate and artificial light 
  \item Urban heat island
  \item Light pollution
\end{enumerate}

City Expansions:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Compact Cities: Limited land area with high population density, thus growing vertically. Most people get around by walking, biking or public transport.
    \begin{itemize}\vspace{2pt}
      \item Ex:"" Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo
    \end{itemize}
  \item Dispersed Cities: Ample land area available for outward expansion. Residents mostly depend on motor vehicles for transportation.
    \begin{itemize}\vspace{2pt}
      \item Ex: Australia, Canada, United States
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsection{Urban Sprawl}
Urban sprawl is the uncontrolled, low-density outward expansion of cities into surrounding undeveloped or agricultural land, often characterised by low-density housing, single-use zoning and increasing reliance on private automobiles. 

Causes:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Prosperity
  \item Ample and Affordable Land
  \item Automobile 
  \item Cheap Gasoline 
  \item Poor Urban Planning
\end{enumerate}

Problems (Natural Capital Degradation):
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Land and Biodiversity: loss of cropland, forests, grasslands, wetlands and habitats
  \item Water: increased use/pollution of surface and groundwater, runoff and flooding, decreased natural sewage treatment
  \item Energy, Air and Climate: increased energy waste, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions 
  \item Economic: decline of downtown business districts, increased unemployment in central, loss of tax base in central
\end{enumerate}

Regulating:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Smart Growth: policies promoting compact, high-density, mixed-use development with access to mass transit
  \item Greenbelts: surrounding large cities with open space for recreation, forestry, or sustainable uses
  \item Urban Growth Boundaries: strict limits beyond which urban development is prohibited
  \item Cluster Development: concentrate high-density housing on part of land while preserving shared open space on the rest of the land (often 40-50\%)
  \item Satellite Towns: smaller metropolitan areas outside the main city, reducing pressure on the core
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsection{Megacities}
Megacities are metropolitan regions with populations exceeding 10 million people. They represent areas of high risk due to their complexity, scale, and vulnerability to environmental, economic, and social stresses.  

\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Growth: By 2030, 41--53 megacities are projected worldwide. Asia alone is expected to host 30 megacities by 2025
  \item Sustainability Risks:\vspace{2pt}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
      \item Rapid urban expansion without adequate planning drives resource depletion
      \item Environmental degradation and loss of ecosystem services
      \item Intensified greenhouse gas emissions from dense populations
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Challenges:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Enormous demand for water, energy, waste management, and housing
  \item High risks of congestion, pollution, and infrastructure strain
  \item Extreme levels of poverty, social inequality, and vulnerability
  \item Fragmentation across economic, societal, and geopolitical dimensions

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Case Study: CO$_2$ Accounting in China}
Findings:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item {Shanghai:} highest per capita GDP and consumption-based CO$_2$ emissions
  \item {Beijing \& Tianjin:} similar per capita consumption-based emissions despite Beijing's local per-capita territorial emissions
  \item {Chongqing:} lowest per capita consumption-based emissions due to lower development
  \item Capital formation is the largest contributor to emissions, driven by rapid growth, infrastructure, and government policy
  \item Household consumption ranks second, with a smaller share than in developed countries
  \item Beijing has large government expenditure as capital
  \item Imports outweigh exports in embodied emissions, dominated by construction
  \item Food imports are high in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin, but minimal in Chongqing
  \item Emissions rise with infrastructure demand, transport networks, and higher incomes
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{-1em}
\colbreak
\section{Carbon Management}

Carbon management in built environment is critical to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, since the building and construction sector accounts ~36\% of final energy use and ~39\% of energy- and process-related \text{CO$_2$} emissions in 2018. 
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Operational Carbon: emissions from building use such as heating, cooling, lighting, and appliances.
  \item Embodied Carbon: emissions from materials and construction, including extraction, manufacturing, transport, and assembly.
  \item Life Cycle Stages: raw materials, transport, manufacturing, construction, operation, and end-of-life (reuse, recycling, landfill, incineration).
  \item Footprint: the total carbon impact is the sum of embodied and operational emissions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Energy-Efficient Buildings}
{Passive Design} reduces energy demand:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Natural Ventilation 
  \item Sunlight Shading and Daylighting
  \item Dynamic Facade
\end{enumerate}

{Active Design} improves system efficiency:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Energy Efficient Chiller 
  \item Energy Recovery System 
  \item Evaporative Cooling 
  \item LED Lights
\end{enumerate}

{Smart Energy Management} uses technology to monitor, control, and optimize energy use:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Intelligent Building Management System (BMS)
\end{enumerate}

{Renewable Energy Integration} generates power on-site, often combined with other strategies to maximise energy generation:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Photovoltaic Panels 
  \item Wind Energy
  \item Tidal Energy 
  \item Geothermal Energy
\end{enumerate}

Types of Buildings:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB): produce as much energy as they consume annually.
  \item Super Low Energy Buildings (SLEB): operate with much lower energy use than conventional buildings.
  \item Positive Energy Buildings (PEB): generate surplus energy that can be stored, shared, or sold.
\end{enumerate}

Surplus Energy from PEBs can be:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Stored: in batteries for later use 
  \item Shared/Sold: exported to the grid or shared with others; a Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) is a tradeable proof of 1 MWh of renewable energy fed into the grid 
  \item Integrated: in smart grids for efficient distribution
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA)}
Fundamentals of DfMA:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Simplifies design for efficient manufacture and assembly.
  \item Identifies and eliminates waste and inefficiency.
  \item Enables end-of-life pathways such as reuse and recycling through design for disassembly.
\end{enumerate}

EOL Scenarios:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Landfill: frame is disposed, contributing to waste and environmental impact 
  \item Downcycle: frame is recycled into lower-value products, extending life but reducing utility 
  \item Incinerate: frame is burned, generating energy but releasing emissions and reducing material recovery 
  \item Re-use: frame is directly reused in new projects, preserving value and minimising waste
\end{enumerate}

Implementation:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Minimize number of components
  \item Modular construction (e.g. prefab units, modules)
  \item Simplify joints (e.g. plug-in connections)
  \item Top-down vertical assembly with self-aligning parts
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC)}
PPVC modules are manufactured and finished off-site before being transported and assembled on-site.
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Improves construction productivity and efficiency
  \item Ensures higher quality through controlled factory conditions
  \item Reduces dust, noise, and on-site disruption
  \item Requires fewer workers on-site, enhancing safety
  \item Speeds up project timelines through parallel off-site fabrication and on-site preparation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Reducing Embodied Carbon}
Concrete and steel are major sources of embodied emissions. Reductions can be achieved through:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Material substitution:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{3pt}
      \item GGBS - 30--50\% replacement of cement
      \item PFA - 15--30\% replacement of cement
      \item RCA - 10\% replacement (coarse fraction)
      \item WCS - 10\% replacement (fine fraction)
    \end{itemize}
  \item Optimizing material use via efficient structural design
  \item Procuring low- or zero-carbon alternatives 
  \item Designing for re-use and recycling at end-of-life
\end{enumerate}

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Materials:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Embodied carbon is released at the start of a building's life, ``locking in'' emissions for decades
  \item Early-phase reductions are critical to avoid long-term carbon lock-in
  \item Operational carbon accumulates over the use phase and can be reduced through retrofits and energy efficiency upgrades
\end{enumerate}

\section{Air Quality}
Air quality is linked to earth’s climate and ecosystems.
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Ambient Air: surrounds us outdoors and to which we are constantly exposed.
\end{enumerate}

Atmosphere Layers:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Thermosphere ($\sim$500km): contains $>$99.9\% of atmospheric gases
  \item Mesosphere ($\sim$100km)
  \item Stratosphere ($\sim$50km): contains 90\% of atmospheric ozone, which acts a protective layer against the sun's harmful UV radiation
  \item Troposphere ($\sim$10km): weather conditions are mainly controlled by physical processes here
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Air Pollutants}
Air pollutants are substances which are unnatural or have higher than normal concentration. They can be transferred to other sectors of the environment\\(i.e. biosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere).

Physical forms:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]

    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{3pt}
      \item Ex. carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, halogen compounds
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{3pt}
      \item Ex. forest fires, deforestation, agri. burning
    \end{itemize}
  \item Industrialization and modernization have increased air pollution due to increased demand for power 
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{3pt}
      \item Ex. Bhopal, India: Gas leak on 2 Dec. 1984 at UCIL Pesticide plant which exposed $>$500,000 people to MIC gas and other chemicals. Approximately 5,200 deaths and several thousand permanent or partial disabilities. 
      \item Ex. Chernobyl, Ukraine: Nuclear accident on 26 Apr. 1986 releasing large quantities of radioactive particles and a radioactive cloud, killing 30 workers from acute radiation poisoning and exposing $>$6000,000 recovery workers.

    \end{itemize}
  \item Stationary sources 
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{3pt}
      \item Ex. industrial and power plants 
    \end{itemize}
  \item Air pollution episodes and accidents
  \item Thermal inversion occurs when warm air settles over cooler air near the ground, holding down the cool air, stopping pollutants rising and scattering
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{3pt}
      \item Ex. Donora, Pennsylvania: temperature inversion on Oct. 1948 caused a wall of smog killing 20 and sickening 7,000, due to fluoride emissions from zinc and steel plants.
      \item Ex. Great Smog of London: in Dec. 1952 caused by black smoke from homes and factories killing 12,000 and bringing transport to a standstill.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Clean Air Act}

US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970 addresses environmental problems; Clean Air Act (CAA) passed to safeguard public health by regulating emissions.
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item EPA is authorized to set standards protecting public health and welfare, and to regulate emissions
  \item CAA is one of most comprehensive air quality laws
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{-1em}
\colbreak
\subsection{Criteria Pollutants}

US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) sets limits for 6 common air pollutants which are most prevalent and harmful to health and the environment, if concentration in ambient air is above certain levels.

Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas from incomplete combustion of carbon:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Sources: cigarette smoking; incomplete burning of fossil fuels; $\sim$77\% (up to 95\% in cities) from motor-vehicle exhaust.
  \item Health: binds to hemoglobin reducing O$_2$ delivery; impairs perception/reflexes; headaches, drowsiness; can trigger angina/heart attacks; harms fetal/child development; aggravates chronic bronchitis, emphysema, anemia;  coma, brain damage, death.
\end{enumerate}

Nitrogen Dioxide (NO$_2$) is a reddish-brown irritant, converts to nitric acid (HNO$_3$) acid rain component:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Sources: fossil-fuel burning in motor vehicles (49\%) power plants \& industries (46\%).
  \item Health: lung irritation/damage; aggravates asthma \& chronic bronchitis; increases susceptibility to respiratory infections (children/elderly).
  \item Environmental: reduces visibility; HNO$_3$ damages trees, soils, aquatic life; corrodes metals/stone; NO$_2$ damages fabrics.
\end{enumerate}

Sulfur Dioxide (SO$_2$) is a colorless irritant mainly from burning sulfur-containing fuel, converts to sulfuric acid (H$_2$SO$_4$) acid rain component:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Sources: coal-burning power plants (88\%); industrial processes (10\%).
  \item Health: breathing problems; airway restriction in asthmatics; chronic exposure cause bronchitis-like
  \item Environmental/Property: visibility loss; H$_2$SO$_4$ damages trees, soils, lakes; SO$_2$ damages paint, paper, leather; both corrode metals, erode stone.
\end{enumerate}
\colbreak
Particulate Matter (PM) are particles and droplets (aerosols) light enough to remain suspended; cause smoke, dust, haze:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Sources: coal burning (40\%); diesel/other fuels in vehicles (17\%); agriculture (plowing, field burning), unpaved roads, construction.
  \item Health: nose/throat irritation, lung damage, bronchitis; aggravates bronchitis/asthma; shortens life; toxic particulates (Pb, Cd, dioxins) can cause mutations, reproductive problems, cancer; damage severity depends on particle size, inhaled number, and individual health; fine/ultrafine penetrate deep lungs (some to bloodstream).
  \item Environmental: reduces visibility; H$_2$SO$_4$ droplets harm trees/soils/aquatic life; corrodes metal; soils/discolors buildings, clothes, fabrics, paints; affects photosynthesis and precipitation (more condensation nuclei).
\end{enumerate}

Ground-level Ozone (O$_3$) is highly reactive irritant and major component of smog:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Sources: Nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (mostly cars/industry) react in sunlight
  \item Health: breathing problems; coughing; eye/nose/throat irritation; aggravates asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, heart disease; reduces resistance to colds/pneumonia; speeds lung aging.
  \item Environmental: damages plants more than many other pollutants; smog reduces visibility; damages rubber, fabrics, paints; large mortality globally.
\end{enumerate}

Lead (Pb) is a toxic metal; emitted to air attached to particulate matter:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Sources: old-house paint, smelters (metal refineries), lead manufacture, storage batteries, (legacy) leaded gasoline.
  \item Health: bioaccumulates; brain/nervous-system damage and mental retardation (esp. children); digestive/other health problems; carcinogenic.
  \item Enivornmental: can harm wildlife
\end{enumerate}

Mathematical dispersion modeling estimates concentration of pollutants at various distances from a source.
\vspace{-1em}
\colbreak
\subsubsection{Acid Deposition (Acid Rain)}
Acid deposition is the accumulation of acids in land, water, or in vegatation as a result of acid rain or direct absorption from atmosphere.
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Acid rain increases the concentration of Al$^{3+}$ in groundwater, adversely affecting plant growth. 
  \item Large sections of established forests have been severely damaged in eastern US.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs)}
Toxic pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects: 
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Highest levels closest to source
  \item Standards set based on availability of control tech  
  \item Ex. asbestos, vinyl chloride, benzene, arsenic
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Indoor Air Pollution}
Indoor air pollution is ubiquitous, taking many forms, especially in developing countries and in mixtures of volatile compounds in modern buildings:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Sources: solid-fuel cooking (e.g. wood) in poorly ventilated homes causes high pollutant levels.
  \item Health: irritation of eyes, nose, throat; headaches, dizziness, fatigue; respiratory diseases; heart disease; cancer; predominantly targets women and young children
  \item Ex. Outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)}

Greenhouse gas accumulation can also lead to adverse effects on the global climate:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Concerns arise over polar ice caps, coastal flooding, and blocking of sun's rays triggering mini ice age
  \item Kyoto Protocol, adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December 1997, proposed that industrialized nations must reduce their collective greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2\% between 2008 to 2012.
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsubsection{Pollution Prevention}
Pollution prevention hierarchy (least to most preferable): dispose $\rightarrow$ treat $\rightarrow$ recover $\rightarrow$ recycle $\rightarrow$ reuse $\rightarrow$ reduce $\rightarrow$ avoid

Pollution reduction or prevention come with a price and may require process alteration, change of fuel, marketting by-products, and temporary plant shutdowns.


\subsection{Good Ozone Depletion}
Gradual thinning of Earth’s stratospheric ozone layer caused by human-released gases containing chlorine and other halogens.
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item {Causes:} Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances (ODS) such as HCFCs, halons, methyl chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride.
  \item {Ozone Hole (Antarctica):} Dramatic springtime loss in the lower stratosphere, most pronounced over the polar regions (Antarctica).
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Largest observed on 24 Sep 2006 (areas with $>\!50\%$ ozone decrease).
      \item Polar vortex: isolated, concentric flow around Antarctica with strong westerlies and little meridional transport.
      \item Springtime phenomenon observed in satellite records (e.g., TOMS/OMI daily minima).
      \item Polar stratospheric clouds form at very cold temperatures and enable reactive chlorine chemistry.
    \end{itemize}
  \item {Impacts:} More UV reaches Earth’s surface $\rightarrow$ increased skin cancer, cataracts, and genetic/immune system damage; broader environmental effects.
  \item {Policy \& Recovery:} Montreal Protocol (1987; amended 1990, 1992) phases out production/consumption of ODS (targeted by 2000); also yields climate benefits since many ODS are potent greenhouse gases; global ozone shows recovery stages.
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\section{Climate Change}
Climate is the statistical description of weather conditions and their variations. Climate change is a shift in the average pattern of weather over long periods. 
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Greenhouse gases (GHGs) cause the greenhouse effect, trapping infrared radiation from the sun 
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{3pt}
      \item Ex. water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and some industrial gases such as chloroflurocarbons (CFCs)
    \end{itemize}
  \item IPCC Report: human activity has increased global surface temperature ($1.09^{\circ}$C comparing 2011-20 vs. 1850–1900; $1.5^{\circ}$C limit in Paris Agreement likely breached in few decades, with overshoot temporary only if emission cuts are immediate \& sustained.
  \item CO$_2$ is the major driver of recent warming (observed rise in CO$_2$ and global temperature, 1880–2010).
  \item Urbanization: by 2050, $\sim$70\% of people will live in cities; cities already consume $\sim$80\% of global material/energy and produce $>$70\% of CO$_2$. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{OCBC Climate Index}

OCBC Climate Index was developed to capture local climate attitudes and actions:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Singaporeans have high awareness of environmental issues, but adoption levels not on par 
  \item Cost and inconvenience cited as top reasons for low adoption; could be due to needs of an individual according to life stages 
  \item Singaporeans love food, struggling most in terms of adoption here but likely to advocate green practices 
  \item Change in mindset is needed to kill bad habits
\end{enumerate}

Lessons Learnt:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Transport: prefer public transport, Park Connector Networks and safe cycling routes
  \item Home: use AC responsibly between $25-27^{\circ}$C
  \item Food: buy local vegetables, eat less meat
  \item Goods: think before purchasing, prefer quality long-lasting items, repair if possible
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{-1em}
\colbreak
\subsection{Effects}
Project and Observed Impacts:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Sea Level Rise: saltwater intrusion raises groundwater salinity; amplifies storm-surge/high-wave impacts on coasts.
  \item Extreme Weather Events:: more frequent/severe events in recent decades.
  \item More Heat Extremes: Small mean warming $\rightarrow$ large increase in heat extremes; fewer cold extremes.
  \item Heavier Rain: warmer air holds more exponentially vapor; when it rains, more falls at once.
  \item Drought: higher water evaporation not offset by precipitation (e.g. western US), snowpack down, runoff spikes from intense events.
  \item Wildfire: increasing area burned; fires now \#1 PM$_{2.5}$ source in western US; offsets air-quality gain.
  \item Human Health: serious threats to well-being from climate crisis.
\end{enumerate}

Future:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Continued CO$_2$ growth will lead to dangerous temperature increases; aggressive decarbonisation is needed to avoid 2 degrees of danger, requiring cutting emissions by $>$ half.
  \item 2023 CO$_2$ emissions $+1.1\%$ (IEA); 2020-23 increase driven by Global South; coal $\sim$65\% of rise.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Mitigation}
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Energy Efficiency: buildings (design, insulation, A/C setpoints $25$-$27^{\circ}$C), industry (heat recovery), transport (EVs, mode shift).
  \item Clean Power: solar, wind, hydro, geothermal; retire inefficient coal; flexible grids and storage.
  \item Fuel Switching: coal $\rightarrow$ natural gas (as a transition), electrification of end-uses.
  \item Non-CO$_2$ Gases: methane leak detection/repair (LDAR), agricultural CH$_4$/N$_2$O reductions, refrigerant management.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Government Role}
Strategies:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Regulatory: set performance standards for CO$_2$/CH$_4$; phase out inefficient coal plants.
  \item Carbon Pricing: carbon taxes or cap-and-trade; recycle revenues to households/innovation.
  \item Subsidy Shifts: phase out fossil subsidies; support efficiency, renewables, clean industry, sustainable agriculture.
  \item Finance \& R\&D: scale public/private investment; de-risk projects; accelerate technology transfer.
  \item Land Use: protect forests; monitor and finance anti-deforestation; sustainable food systems.
\end{enumerate}

  \item Health: surveillance of climate-sensitive diseases; protect vulnerable populations.
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\section{Nonrenewable Energy}

Nonrenewable Energy (NRE) comes from finite sources and is consumed much faster than can be naturally replenished.
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Nonrenewable energy fuels $\sim \frac{3}{4}$ of the world's commercial energy.
  \item Global energy demand is projected to increase 28\% between 2015-40
  \item Net energy is the only energy that counts: usable energy minus energy automatically wasted in finding, processing and transporting it to users.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Coal}
Coal is the world's most abundant fossil fuel:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Generates $\sim$40\% of global electricity at inexpensive cost, with potential to cover global energy needs into 22$^{nd}$ century.
  \item Well-developed technology, with air pollution reducible by improved technology
  \item Burned industrially for iron, steel and other products
  \item Major CO$_2$, SO$_2$ emitter, along with soot, and toxic industructible mercury and radioactive materials
  \item Major factor in development of emerging and developing economies.
  \item Process: heat generated boils water to produce steam which spins a turbine to product electricity. Steam can be recooled, condensed and reused. 
\end{enumerate}

Synfuels burn cleaner than coal, but lower net energy and higher cost per unit of energy than conventional coal:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Gasification: forms syngas (of H$_2$, CO, CO$_2$). 
  \item Liquefaction: forms methanol/synthetic gasoline.
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsection{Oil}
Crude oil is a black liquid of different combustible hydrocarbons, trappened under crust or under the seafloor, requiring drilling and refining.
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Crude oil is biggest source of commercial energy (85 million barrels of oil /day), oil is consued 4$\times$ faster than being discovered, crude oil will be depleted over 80\% between 2050-2100.
  \item High net energy yield, easy to transport, low land use, and well developed tech
  \item Need to find substitutes within 50 years, with fluctuating market price and high pollution
  \item Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC): 13 countries holding ~78\% of proven reserves; long-time supply influence. 
  \item Process: Fractional distillation by boiling points; yields fuels \& {petrochemicals} (plastics, fibers, solvents, medicines, etc.). 
\end{enumerate}

Unconventional Oil is found in poorly connected poors, or is too viscious/heavy so buoyant forces are insufficient to expel them from the reservoir and requires more technology:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Oil Sands: extra heavy, viscious crude oil trapped in unconsolidated sand; most in Canada and Venezuela; expensive and emission intensive
  \item Oil Shales: fine grained sedimentary rocks containing kerogen from which shale oil and gas are produced; mainly in US, Australia, China, Brazil, Estonia
  \item Tight Oil: light crude oil in formations of low permeability; mainly in Russia, US, China, Argentia, Libya
  \item Hydraulic Fracturing: extracts tight oil/gas; carries environmental risks (water, seismicity, fugitive emissions). 
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsection{Natural Gas}
Natural gas is a mixture of gases (50-90\% methane) and other hydrocarbons (e.g. propane, butane) often found above crude oil.
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Known reserves should last 62-125 years, with high net energy yield, abundance, transport and usage breakthroughts, energy security concerns
  \item Low net energy density complicates handling
  \item Process: refine to remove impurities/NGLs
  \item Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG): when natural gas is tapped, propane and butane gases are liquefied and removed
\end{enumerate}

Unconvential Gas:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Tight Gas: trapped in low-permeability sandstones/limestones; mainly US or North Sea.
  \item Shale Gas: trapped in shale (acts as source and reservoir); produced via horizontal drilling + hydraulic fracturing.
  \item Coal Bed Methane (CBM): methane adsorbed in coal seams; co-produces significant water which must be removed (adds cost/handling).
  \item Methane Hydrates: methane trapped in ice lattices under seafloor/permafrost; large potential but technical \& environmental risks.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{CO$_2$ Emissions}
CO$_2$ emissions per unit of electrical energy:\\Coal-fired electricity $>$ Coal synfuel $>$ Coal $>$ Tar sand $>$ Oil $>$ Natural gas $>$ Nuclear $>$ Geothermal
\colbreak

\subsection{Nuclear Power}
Nuclear power is the only nonrenewable clean energy, formed from nuclear fission:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Role: large-scale baseload with \emph{no direct} CO$_2$ at the plant; constrained by cost, low net energy yield (full fuel cycle), radioactive wastes, safety/security concerns.
  \item Basics: induced fission chain reaction in a controlled reactor; moderators and control rods sustain steady power.
  \item Fuel Cycle: natural uranium (99.28\% $^{238}$U, 0.71\% $^{235}$U) enriched to $\sim$3.5--5\% $^{235}$U $\rightarrow$ UO$_2$ pellets $\rightarrow$ fuel rods/assemblies.
  \item Process: reactor heat $\rightarrow$ steam $\rightarrow$ turbine; cooling via once-through water or cooling towers.
  \item Accidents: Three Mile Island (1979), Chernobyl (1986), Fukushima (2011) led to upgraded safety standards and regulatory scrutiny.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Energy Efficiency}
A large share of commercial energy is wasted; roughly half is avoidable through better tech/operations.

Techniques:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Industry: cogeneration/ combined heat and power (CHP), replacing energy-wasting electri motors with variable speed motors, recycling materials, swithing to LED lighting

  \item Buildings: solar heating, superinsulation for heating, high-efficiency HVAC, green roofs, daylighting, sustainable building materials, straw bale houses.
\end{enumerate}

Waste still exists due to artificially cheap fossil fuels (due to subsidies and exclusion of environmental costs), few incentives and inadequate energy-efficiency building codes and appliance standards.

\colbreak
\section{Renewable Energy}
Renewable Energy (RE) is replenished by natural processes at a rate equal or exceeding rate of use.
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Drivers: growing energy demand, environmental concerns, economic benefits, energy security, cost competitiveness

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Solar Energy}
Solar is the largest energy source, inexhaustible, and captured as heat (absorption by gases/liquids/solids) or photoreaction (photon-driven electron flow).

Photovoltaic (PV)/ Solar cells generate electricity through the photovoltaic effect; sunlight on semiconductor releases electrons, and current flows through an external circuit:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Cosine Effect: solar irradiance is maximal when sun is directly overhead, and reduced at anglessolar 
  \item Variance: solar irradiance varies with latitudes (high variance at high altitudes, low in tropics); dependent on season and weather

\section{Sustainable Water Resources}

Water is vital for all aspects of life but is poorly managed:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item $\sim$71\% of Earth's surface is water, with 96.5\% held in oceans.
  \item Only $\sim$3\% is freshwater; $<1\%$ readily available in rivers, lakes and streams.
  \item Water cycle continually collects, purifies, recycles and redistributes water, but human activities purposefully and unintentionally alter it.
\end{enumerate}

Issues:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Economic: vital for reducing poverty and producing food and energy 
  \item National and Global Security: increasing tensions with limited shared water resources 
  \item Environmental: excessive withdrawal from rivers and aquifers results in dropping water tables, shrinking lakes and loss of wetlands 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Groundwater}
Groundwater is the water in soil pore spaces and in rock fractures below ground:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Water table: level below which all pores are water-filled; above which is air-filled.
  \item Zone of Saturation: region below water table where all pores are completely filled with water.
  \item Aquifers: underground caverns and porous layers of sand, gravel or bedrock through which groundwater flows. Most are replenished by natural recharge (precipitation percolating down), others by lateral recharge (nearby rivers and streams).
  \item Pollution: can be contaminated when polluted surface water with nutrients or chemicals drains into the groundwater environment. 
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsection{Surface Water}
Surface water is the water from precipitation and snowmelt that flows over land into lakes, wedlands, streams, rivers, estuaries and ultimately oceans:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Surface runoff: precipitation that does not infiltrate the ground or return to atmosphere by evaporation.
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{3pt}
    \item Reliable surface runoff: $\sim \frac{1}{3}$ of annual runoff available as freshwater for human use\\(rest is lost in seasonal floods).
    \end{itemize}
  \item Watershed/ Drainage Basin: land from which surface water drains into a particular water body.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Global Water Use}

Water can be extracted, used, recycled and reused. Consumption is the final use of water, after which reuse is not possible. Extraction has risen much faster than consumption, indicating intensified exploitation.

Causes of Water Scarcity:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Dry climate and drought
  \item Too many people sharing a supply
  \item Wasteful, inefficient water use
\end{enumerate}

Consequences of Water Scarcity:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item $\sim$1\,billion people lack regular access to clean water.
  \item $\sim$40\% gap between demand and available water projected by 2030.
  \item 1.8\,billion people use drinking water sources contaminated by faeces.
  \item $\geq$80\% of wastewater returns untreated to the environment.
  \item $\sim$30\% of global water abstraction lost via leakage.
  \item Water scarcity already affects $\sim$40\% of the world.
  \item 70--90\% of water use is for agriculture; $\sim$70\% more food needed by 2050.
  \item Business risks: environmental, political, operational and reputational risks propagate along supply chains from upstream suppliers to downstream customers.
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsection{Increasing Freshwater Supplies}

Waste Reduction:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Redesign manufacturing processes and recycle water in industry 
  \item Landscape with plants requiring little water, use drip irrigation, fix leaks, use water meters, use water-efficient appliances and fixtures
  \item Raise water prices, require water conservation in water-short cities, purify and reuse water for houses and offices
\end{enumerate}

Groundwater Withdrawal:
\begin{enumerate}[$+$]
  \item Useful for drinking and irrigation, available year-round, widely available, renewable if sustainable, no evaporation loss, cheaper to extract 
\end{enumerate}\vspace{-1pt}
\begin{enumerate}[$-$]
  \item Overpumping can deplete aquifers and sink land, pollution of aquifers, saltwater intrusion into drinking water near coasts, reduced water flows into surface waters, increased cost and contamination from deeper wells
\end{enumerate}

Dams and Reservoirs:
\begin{enumerate}[$+$]
  \item Provides irrigation water above and below dam and drinking water, recreation (fishing), hydropower, reduces downstream flooding.
\end{enumerate}\vspace{-1pt}
\begin{enumerate}[$-$]
  \item Flooded land destroys habitat or displaces people, large evaporation losses, deprives downstream habitat of nutrient-rich silt, risk of failure, disrupts fish migration 
\end{enumerate}

Desalination:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Distillation: heat saltwater until evaporation and recondense as freshwater; less commercialised for large scale plants.
  \item Reverse Osmosis: high pressure forces saltwater through membrane filter to remove salt; higher productivity and efficiency leads to high commercialisation for large scale plants.
\end{enumerate}

Transporting surface area across regions

\subsection{Case Study: Aral Sea}
Issues:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Rivers diverted for irrigation (cotton, crops) since 1960.

\end{enumerate}\vspace{-1pt}
\begin{enumerate}[$-$]
  \item Kills thousands annually and cause property damage 
  \item Human activities increase risk; e.g. removal of water-absorbing vegetation and building on wetlands which absorb floodwaters 
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{3pt}
      \item Ex. Hurricane Katrina, 2005: damage intensified due to degradation or removal of coastal wetlands
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Case Study: Bangladesh Floodplains}
Issues:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]

\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsection{Water Pollution}

Water Pollution is any change in water quality that harms organisms or makes water unsuitable for desired uses:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Point sources: discharge at specific locations\\(e.g. factories, mines, oil tankers, sewage outfalls).
  \item Nonpoint sources: diffuse inputs from broad areas (e.g. agricultural runoff, urban streets, logged forests, parking lots, lawns, golf courses).
  \item Major pollutants: pathogens, oxygen-demanding wastes, plant nutrients (N, P), organic/inorganic chemicals, sediments, heavy metals, heat.
  \item Endocrine disruptors (EDCs): chemicals (e.g. some pesticides, metals, additives, personal care products) that interfere with hormones in aquatic organisms, causing growth, reproductive abnormalities and sex changes.
\end{enumerate}

Solutions:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Prevent groundwater contamination 
  \item Reduce point source pollution 
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{3pt}
      \item Clean Water Act (CWA), Water Quality Act (WQT): set standards for allowed levels of key water pollutants, and require pollutants to get permits limiting discharge
      \item Discharge Trading Policy: permit holders can pollute more if credits bought from permit holders underplluting; market forces reduce water pollution; could overpollute areas where credits are bought
  \end{itemize}
  \item Reduce nonpoint runoff 
  \item Treated wastewater and sewage for reuse
  \item Find substitutes for toxic pollutants 
  \item Reduce air pollution 
  \item Reduce poverty, and population growth
\end{enumerate}

Individual Actions:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Use manure/compost instead of inorganic fertilizer 
  \item Minimise pesticides, especially near water 
  \item Prevent yard wastes entering storm drains 
  \item Do not flush medicine/chemicals 
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{-1em}
\colbreak
\subsubsection{Cleansing}
Streams:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Biodegradable wastes cause an oxygen sag curve, reducing organisms with high oxygen requirements.
  \item Recovery downstream from oxygen demanding wastes or heated wastes with time, if not overloaded
\end{enumerate}

Lakes and Reservoirs:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Pollutants persist due to limited vertical mixing and low flow
  \item Eutrophication: nutrient enrichment (nitrates, phosphates from runoff) $\rightarrow$ algal blooms, turbidity.
  \item Cultural Eutrophication: human activity (farmland, fertiliser, sewage) accelerates algal/ cyanobacteria blooms, O$_2$ depletion and fish kills.
\end{enumerate}

Groundwater:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Pollutants (fertilisers, pesticides, gasoline, solvents) can seep into aquifers.
  \item Slow flow, low dissolved O$_2$ and microbial activity; cold temperatures slow waste decomposition.
  \item Natural cleansing may take decades-millennia; prevention is cheaper than cleanup.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Drinking Water}
Developed Countries:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Water stored in reservoirs to let particulates settle, increase dissolved O$_2$ and improve taste 
  \item Then treated in purification plants to meet drinking water standards
\end{enumerate}

Developing Countries:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Exposing clear plastic bottle to intense sunlight for solar disinfection 
  \item Portable devices, e.g. LifeStraw to convert contaminated water
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsubsection{Ocean Pollution}
Issues:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item $\sim$40\% of people live near coasts; coastal population projected to double by 2050.
  \item 80\% of marine pollution originates on land; large shares of sewage enter oceans untreated.
  \item Nutrient-rich runoff causes harmful algal blooms and oxygen-depleted (dead) zones.
  \item Residential areas, factories and farms contribute to pollution of coastal waters and bays
  \item Oil spills:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Destroy insulation of fur and water-proofing of feathers, causing hypothermia and death.
      \item Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons cause heart damage and developmental problems in fish.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Key control: reduce land-, air- and river-borne pollution entering the seas.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sewage Treatment}
Rural and Subarban:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Sewage discharged into a septic tank 
  \item Grease and oil rise up, solids fall and are decomposed by bacteria 
\end{enumerate}

Urban:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Raw sewage undergoes one or two levels of treatment 
  \item Primary: Remove large floating objects and allow suspended solid to settle out 
  \item Secondary: Aerobic bacterial removes ~90\% of dissolved and biodegradable, oxygen-demanding organic wastes
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak

      \item Municipal solid waste (MSW): from homes and workplaces (paper, food, cans, bottles, e-waste).
    \end{itemize}
  \item E-waste: rapidly growing stream from discarded electronics; wastes resources and releases toxic metals and organics when poorly managed.
  \item Hazardous Waste: threatens health/environment; poisonous, chemically reactive, corrosive, flammable (e.g. solvents, medical waste, batteries, ash).
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Organic compounds: solvents, pesticides, PCBs, dioxins.
      \item Toxic heavy metals: Pb, Hg, As, etc.

      \item Low recycling for plastics, textiles/leather, glass, food (single-digit or low-teen \%).
    \end{itemize}
  \item Challenge: domestic and food waste growing; need stronger minimisation and recycling.
\end{enumerate}


\colbreak
\subsection{Waste Strategies}

Waste Hierarchy sets priorities based on sustainability and preference:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Reduce (lower waste produced)
  \item Reuse (use materials repeatedly)
  \item Recycle (use materials to make new products)
  \item Recovery (recovery energy from waste)
  \item Landfill (safe disposal of waste)
\end{enumerate}

Strategies:

  \item Waste Management:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Involves reducing environmental harm of waste 
      \item Involves mixing wastes and transferring them to different parts of the environment (e.g. landfills), but can contribute to air and water pollution and land degradation
    \end{itemize}
  \item Waste Reduction:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Involves producing much less waste and pollution 
      \item Wastes produced are considered potential resources for reuse, recycling or composing
    \end{itemize}
  \item Integrated Waste Management:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Involves variety of stragies for both waste reduction and management
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Incineration}
Waste-to-energy incinerators burn mixed solid waste and recover energy to produce stream for heating or electricity. 
\begin{enumerate}[$+$]
  \item Reduces trash volume, reducing need for landfills 
  \item Low water pollution, low air pollution with modern pollution controls (filters, scrubbers)
  \item Concentrates hazardous waste into ash for burial
  \item Selling of metals; Sale of energy reduces cost
\end{enumerate}\vspace{-1pt}
\begin{enumerate}[$-$]
  \item Expensive, difficult to site 
  \item Some air and CO$_2$ pollution 
  \item Output approach encourages wate production
  \item Competes with recycling for burnables like paper
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{-1em}
\colbreak
\subsection{Gasification}
Gasifications converts waste into syngas by reacting with stream/ limited oxygen at high temperature ($\sim$1300$^\circ$C):
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Plasma Gasification: uses plasma arc ($>2000^\circ$C) to break waste into syngas and inert slag
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sanitary Landfills}
Sanitary landfills are engineered sites isolating waste from the environment until it is safe, i.e. degraded biologically, chemically and physically:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Features: liners, leachate collection, gas collection, daily cover, monitoring.
  \item Ex. Semakau, SG: $\sim$3.5\,km$^2$, capacity $\sim$63 million m$^3$ for incineration ash and some non-incinerables.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}[$+$]\vspace{-1pt}
  \item No open burning, little odor 
  \item Low groundwater pollution if sited well

  \item Recycle: separate and recycle paper, metals, glass, plastics and buy recycled-content products.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Reuse}
Reuse extends product life, saves resources and energy, cuts pollution and waste, and creates local jobs:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Strategies: yard sales, flea markets, secondhand shops, online platforms, refillable bottles and containers.
  \item Refillable glass and PET containers: technically feasible but often less favoured by corporations due to logistics and cost; bottle deposits and national bottle bills can promote reuse.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Recycling}
Recycling reprocesses discard materials into new, useful products:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Types of waste:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}

    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Primary/closed-loop: same product type (e.g. can $\rightarrow$ can).
      \item Secondary: different product (e.g. tires $\rightarrow$ rubberised asphalt).
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}[$+$]\vspace{-1pt}
  \item Reduces air, water pollution and GHG emissions 
  \item Saves energy, resources and landfill space
\end{enumerate}\vspace{-1pt}
\begin{enumerate}[$-$]
  \item Costs more than landfills, and may lose money for items such as glass and some plastics 
  \item Source separation can be inconvenient
\end{enumerate}\vspace{-1em}
\colbreak
Waste Biomass are trees, grasses or other construction waste which can be recycled into fuels and materials:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Cogeneration and material recycling (e.g. reconstituted particle board for construction) increase resource efficiency.
  \item Composting:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Bacterial decomposition of yard trimmings and food scraps.
      \item Produces soil amendment that supplies nutrients, reduces erosion and increases water-holding capacity.
      \item Requires control of odours and exclusion of toxic materials.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Household Solid Waste:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs): machines/workers separate recyclables for sale as raw materials; residuals are landfilled or burned.
  \item Source Separation: households/businesses pre-sort recyclables (glass, paper, metals, plastics, organics); higher quality and energy savings.
  \item Pay-as-you-throw (PAYT): households pay per bag/bin of mixed waste but not for separated recyclables; strong incentive to reduce and sort.
  \item Ex. Singapore: NEA initiatives for voluntary recycling by households and trade premises; national recycling bins and campaigns; focus on waste minimisation.
\end{enumerate}

Plastics:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item High-value engineering plastics can be separated from complex goods (computers, appliances, autos) and converted to pellets.
  \item Benefits:

    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsubsection{Waste Reduction}
Government Policies:

\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Bioremediation: use bacteria/enzymes to break down toxic substances.
  \item Phytoremediation: use plants to absorb, filter and remove contaminants from soil and water.
  \item Incineration: heating up to $~2000^\circ$C can break down or convert harmful chemicals
  \item Plasma Arc Torch: passing electrical current through gas to generate an electric arc and very high temperatures can create plasma to decompose liquid or solid hazardous waste
\end{enumerate}

Storage Options:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Deep-well Disposal: pump liquid wastes under pressure into porous rock far below aquifers.
  \item Surface Impoundments: lined ponds, pits or lagoons for liquid wastes (risk of leakage/overflow).
  \item Long-term Retrievable Storage: drums stored in secure, monitored facilities for future treatment (for materials which cannot be detoxified or destroyed)
  \item Secure Landfills: drums buried in carefully designed and monitored sites. 
\end{enumerate}

Mercury is a highly toxic element and potent neurotoxin:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Released by coal burning, incineration, metal and cement production, mining, waste handling.
  \item Highly mobile cycling between atmopshere and Earth's surface; bioaccumulates and biomagnifies, especially in aquatic food chains.
  \item Control: reduce emissions, phase out mercury-containing products, advise on fish consumption, use safer alternatives.
\end{enumerate}

Lead is a highly toxic metal and strong poison and neurotoxin which can build up in the body:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Released in old lead-based paints, contaminated dust/soil, plumbing, legacy exhausts

  \item Globally $\sim\frac{1}{3}$ of food calories produced are wasted; enough to feed $\sim$3 billion people.
  \item Food waste $\sim$8\% of global GHG emissions; contributes to deforestation and water depletion.
  \item Problems: contaminates recyclables, causes odour and vermin if mismanaged; adds load to incinerators and landfills.
  \item Management options: source reduction, redistribution, separate collection for treatment (composting, anaerobic digestion), public education.
  \item Ex. Singapore: food waste $\sim$10\% of total waste and has grown by $\sim$40\% over 10 years.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Towards a Low-Waste Society}

Policies:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Grassroots Actions: keep large number of incinerators, landfills and hazardous-waste treatment plants from being built in local areas.
  \item Environmental Justice: everyone deserves equal protection from environmental hazards.
  \item International Treaties: phase out persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as DDT, PCBs and dioxins.
  \item New vision:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Everything is connected; there is no real ``throw away''.
      \item Polluters/producers pay full costs.
      \item Do not mix hazardous and recyclable wastes.
      \item Mimic nature by reusing, recycling and composting.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Environmental Hazards and Health}

Environmental hazards and health risks arise from various factors:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Hazard: any source of potential damage, harm or adverse health effect (e.g. chemical, pathogen, energy source).
  \item Risk: probability that exposure to a hazard will cause harm.
  \item Risk Assessment: estimate how much harm a hazard can cause to human health or the environment.
  \item Risk Management: decide whether and how to reduce risk, and at what cost.
\end{enumerate}

Types of Hazards:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Biological: pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi).
  \item Chemical: harmful substances in air, water, soil, food, products.
  \item Physical: fires, earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, storms, radiation.
  \item Cultural: unsafe work, unsafe roads, crime, poverty, war.
  \item Lifestyle: smoking, unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, excessive alcohol, unsafe sex.
\end{enumerate}

Routes of Exposure:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Environmental media: air, drinking water, food, soil.
  \item Entry pathways:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Inhalation (breathing in airborne contaminants)
      \item Ingestion (drinking/eating contaminated water or food)
      \item Dermal/eye absorption (through skin or eyes)
      \item Injection (needles, bites, medical procedures)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsection{Biological Hazards}
Types:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Non-transmissible Diseases: not caused by living organisms; do not spread person-to-person (e.g. cardiovascular disease, asthma, diabetes, most cancers).
  \item Infectious Diseases: caused by pathogens that invade and multiply in the body (e.g. malaria, cholera, dengue).
  \item Transmissible Diseases: infectious diseases that spread person-to-person (e.g. tuberculosis, flu, measles, COVID-19).
  \item Epidemic: large outbreak in a region or country.
  \item Pandemic: epidemic that spreads globally (e.g. HIV/AIDS, COVID-19).
  \item A small number of diseases account for a large share of global deaths (respiratory, digestive, cardiovascular, cancers and a few major infections).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Tuberculosis (TB)}
Tuburcolosis is spread by the TB bacterium:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item $\sim \frac{1}{3}$ of world population is infected with TB bacterium; most infections latent.
  \item Challenges:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{3pt}
      \item Underfunded screening and control programmes, especially in developing countries.
      \item Most TB strains have developed genetic resistance to majority of antibiotics.
      \item Crowded living conditions and increased air travel have increased person-to-person contacts.
      \item New multidrug-resistant TB and extensively drug-resistant TB.
      \item Low financial incentive to develop new TB drugs.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsubsection{Viral Diseases}
Viruses evolve quickly, are not affected by antibiotics and can kill many people:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Influenza: global killer transmitted via droplets and aerosols.
  \item HIV/AIDS: attacks and weakens immune system; no cure and limited vaccine coverage.
  \item Hepatitis B: causes serious liver disease and cancer.
  \item Emergent: West Nile, SARS, MERS and others.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Malaria}
Malaria is caused by a prasite sprite through Anopheles mosquitoes, and via blood transfusions and shared needles;
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item $\sim$40\% of world population lives in malaria-risk areas; kills thousands daily (mainly children).
  \item Climate change may expand mosquito ranges and lengthen transmission seasons.
  \item Control strategies:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Antimalarial drugs and vaccines (under development/limited rollout).
      \item Insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying.
      \item Environmental management to reduce mosquito breeding sites.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Preventing Infectious Diseases}
Solutions:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Increase research on tropical diseases and vaccines.
  \item Improve nutrition and reduce poverty.
  \item Improve sanitation, hygiene and access to safe drinking water.
  \item Reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.
  \item Expand vaccination and basic healthcare.
  \item Public education (handwashing, safe sex, food).
  \item Strengthen surveillance and rapid response to outbreaks.
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsection{Antibiotic Resistance}

Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria evolve to survive exposure to antibiotics.

Drivers:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Overprescription and misuse (wrong drug, wrong dose, viral infections).
  \item Not completing full antibiotic courses.
  \item Routine use in animal feed to promote growth.
  \item Poor infection control and hygiene.
\end{enumerate}

Consequences:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Infections become harder or impossible to treat.
  \item Longer illness, hospital stays and higher medical costs.
  \item Increased mortality from once-treatable diseases.
  \item Antibiotic residues and resistant bacteria in wastewater, rivers, soils and sediments.
  \item Resistance genes spread via water, food chains, livestock and human travel.
\end{enumerate}

Solutions:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Antibiotic stewardship: stricter prescribing and regulation in medicine and agriculture.
  \item Infection prevention: vaccination, hygiene, safer sex and food safety.
  \item Improved waste and wastewater treatment to reduce environmental antibiotic loads.
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsection{Chemical Hazards}

Types:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Toxic Chemical: can cause temporary or permanent harm or death (e.g. arsenic, lead, benzene).
  \item Hazardous Chemical: toxic and reactive and whose potential for injury is high if released\\(e.g. acetaldehyde, bromine chloride)
  \item Carcinogens: cause or promote cancer\\(e.g. benzene, radon, UV).
  \item Mutagens: cause or increase frequency of DNA mutations (e.g. nitrous acid).
  \item Teratogens: cause harm or birth defects in embryos or fetuses (e.g. cadmium, formaldehyde).
\end{enumerate}

Bioaccumulation and Biomagnification:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Persistent chemicals move through air, water, soil and food webs.
  \item Bioaccumulation: build-up of chemicals in an organism when intake $>$ breakdown/excretion.
  \item Biomagnification: increasing chemical concentration at higher trophic levels in a food chain (i.e. predators higher up).
  \item Fat-soluble, persistent chemicals are most prone to bioaccumulation and biomagnification.
\end{enumerate}

Effects:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Long-term, low-dose exposure can disrupt:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Immune system: weakened disease defence.
      \item Nervous system: brain, spinal cord and nerves. 
      \item Endocrine system: hormone-producing glands.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Neurotoxins: damage nervous system\\(e.g. methylmercury, lead, pesticides, solvents).
  \item Hormonally Active Agents (HAAs): mimic, block or alter hormones, disrupting endocrine system (e.g. aluminium, mercury, PCBs)
  \item Many household and consumer products contain mixtures of potentially hazardous chemicals; low-level residues are found in human blood and tissues worldwide.
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsection{Toxicology}

Toxicology studies the harmful effects of chemicals on humans and other organisms:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Toxicity: measure of how harmful a substance is at a given dose.
  \item Dose: amount of a substance a person takes in (ingested, inhaled or absorbed).
  \item Response: health damage resulting from exposure to a certain dose.
  \item Acute effect: rapid, short-term response to a single exposure or from multiple in a short time.
  \item Chronic effect: long-term response to repeated or continuous exposure.
\end{enumerate}

Estimating toxicity:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Laboratory tests:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Typically use rats, mice or other test organisms, extrapolated to humans with safety factors.
      \item Alternative: cell/tissue cultures, computer models, epidemiological studies.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Dose--response Curve: describes change in effect on an organism caused by different exposure to a substance after a certain exposure time. 
  \item Lethal Dose: dose which kills animal
  \item Median Lethal Dose, LD$_{50}$: dose that kills 50\% of test animals in 18-day period.
  \item Uncertainties:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{3pt}
      \item Genetic differences between individuals.
      \item Mixtures of multiple chemicals.
      \item Effects of low doses and long-term exposures.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\colbreak
\subsection{Managing Chemical Risks}

Solutions:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Pollution Prevention:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Substitute safer, less toxic chemicals.
      \item Redesign processes to minimise hazardous waste generation.
      \item Recycle chemicals in closed loops to prevent environmental release.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Precautionary Principle:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item When there is reasonable but incomplete evidence of serious or irreversible harm, take preventive action rather than wait for more proof.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Phase out Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs):
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\vspace{2pt}
      \item Resistant to degradation, bioaccumulate and biomagnify (e.g. DDT, PCBs, dioxins, furans).
      \item International treaties aim to phase out or restrict POPs.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Risk Evaluation}

Risk Analysis:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Risk Assessment: scientific study of risk magnitude and likelihood.
  \item Risk Acceptance: social and personal judgement of how much risk is tolerable.
  \item Risk Management: policy and economic decisions on how to reduce or share risk.
\end{enumerate}

System Reliability $=$ \text{Tech. Reliability} $\times$ \text{Human Reliability}:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Even highly reliable technology can be undermined by human error.
  \item Compare risks objectively using data.
  \item Identify which risks are most serious and most controllable.
  \item Focus policies on major lifestyle and environmental risks (e.g. smoking, air pollution) rather than minor hazards.

  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*.)]
      \item Binary search, hashing values $start:mid$ locally and remotely and compare. If the hash doesn't match, recurse on the left, else recurse on the right to find the start point of corruption.

      \item Binary search, hashing each $mid$ on the server and check if it exists in the same position locally.

      \item Recursive Divide-and-Conquer

      \item  Minimising data transfer by comparing hashes instead of entire files. Hashes must not collide.

      \item No, it is a list of hashes

      \item An arbitrary hash function may lead to hash collisions and missing photos undetected

      \item Yes, it solves in $O(n)$.

      \item 

      \item Invariant: preserve difference in set sizes

      \item Ensures the hash function uniquely maps each missing photo to a value not in $H_l$

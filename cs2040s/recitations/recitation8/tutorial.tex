\begin{enumerate}[Q\arabic*.]
  \item Use 4 cardinal direction vertices to represent an intersection. Connect each vertex with outgoing edges to the valid states in the next step: going straight (weight 0) or turning right (weight 1). Finally, run SSSP.

  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
      \item Djikstra

      \item Split each node to odd, even. For every edge ($u$,$v$) create edge ($u_{even}$, $v_{odd}$) and ($v_{even}$, $u_{odd}$). Find SSSP from Paris even to Moscow odd, and even and return the lower of the two paths.

      \item For every city, create an edge between the odd and even nodes to address overnight stays. Also create a single source node connected to even and odd starting nodes from which to start searching.

\begin{enumerate}[Q\arabic*.]
  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*.)]
      \item Use an adjacency matrix. Each vertex is a currency. Edge direction implies a conversion between currencies, with the weight as the exchange rate.

      \item Product of weights on cycles do not exceed 1.

      \item Modify relax so triangle inequality is $\delta(S,v) \geq \delta(S, u) \times \delta(u,v)$ 
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Make duplicate graph $G'$ and connect all edges from supply drop nodes over to same supply drop node in the duplicate graph. Run SSSP from source to end in duplicate. Space complexity: $O(V)$

      \item \lstinline|printf|, \lstinline|<<|

      \item stdout buffer is full without flushing. Adding "\\n" flushes the line.

// Read "arraySize" items from "File" and place in the "outputArray"

  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*.)]
      \item Fails if attempting to open a file descriptor with file table entry set to Op Type: Write.

      \item Fails when the file descriptor is not found in open file table.

      \item File descriptor tables are unique in each PCB, so processes cannot overwrite other processes file descriptors.

      \item Files with file table entry set to Op Type: Read can be opened but the file is locked for writes.

      \item stdin, stdout have fd 0, 1 per process and are linked by the open file table to the "real" stdin, stdout files. With piping, the processes overwrite 0 and 1 in the PCB to the files passed.

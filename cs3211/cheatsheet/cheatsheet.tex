\section{Introduction}
Parallel Comptuing is the simultaneous use of multiple processing units to solve problems efficiently. 
Parallelization:
\begin{enumerate}[\roman*.]
  \item Decomposition: of problem into parallel tasks
  \item Scheduling: tasks onto processes/threads, with synchronisation for any dependencies
  \item Mapping: 
\end{enumerate}

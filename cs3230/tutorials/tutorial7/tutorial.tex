\begin{enumerate}[Q\arabic*).]
  \item (b); Only pairs that can exist on the same CD (i.e. such as in the optimal soln) can fit the formula.

  \item (a); Exchange smallest file $f$ with smallest in existing pair $(f_1, f_2)$ keeping the same CD count. 
    (b); Pairing smallest and largest files which fit on the same CD does not increase the CD count. 

  \item Sort in $\Theta(n\log n)$ then iterate through current smallest $a_i$ and largest $a_j$. If $a_i+a_j \leq 100MB$ then burn both and keep iterating, else burn $a_j$ in a CD and decrement $j$. 

    For the test case, we get $4$

  \item (a); Picking last start leaves all intervals before free for inclusion 

  \item Sort by end time in $\Theta(n\log n)$. Iterate through each activity, add it if the start $\geq$ last selected interval's end time.

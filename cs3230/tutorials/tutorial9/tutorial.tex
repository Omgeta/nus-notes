\begin{enumerate}[Q\arabic*).]
  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*.)]
      \item True; reduce to solving for optimum and checking if $\leq k$
      \item True; reduce to solving decision problem $O(n)$ times
      \item True; follows from contraposition in (a) of polynomial-reduction
      \item True; follows from contraposition in (b) of polynomial-reduction
    \end{enumerate}

  \item (c); this reduction ignores the preservation of set $S$ 

  \item (a); trivial\\
    (b); if a subset sums to $\frac{S}{2}$, just choosing those items for the knapsack satisfies $W \leq \frac{S}{2} \leq V$\\
    (c); since every item has same weight as value, and we solve for $W \leq \frac{S}{2} \leq V$, we force $W = V = \frac{S}{2}$ so the knapsack contains exactly half the sum $\rightarrow$ Partition YES

  \item Algorithm: transform unweighted graph $G$ into complete weighted $G'$ with $w(u, v) = \begin{cases}1,&\text{if $(u, v)\in G$}\\2, &\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$

    Transformation is $O(n^2)$ by building edges between each of the $n$ edges, and comparing with original graph in $O(1)$ each.

    Suppose HC-Yes, then the same tour in $G'$ costs $|V|$ due to each edge only costing $1$ $\rightarrow$ TSP-YES for $|V|$

    Suppose TSP-Yes, then the tour must have all edges cost 1 to keep total cost $\leq |V| \rightarrow$ HC-YES

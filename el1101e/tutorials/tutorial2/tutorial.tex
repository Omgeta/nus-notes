\begin{enumerate}[Q\arabic*.]
  \item No; minimal pairs exist (e.g. in \textipa{[kano]} vs \textipa{[xano]}, and \textipa{[kali]} vs \textipa{[xali]}) with different meanings.

  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*.)]
      \item Yes; they do not occur in the same environment (complementary distribution): \textipa{[\r*u]} occurs only between voiceless consonants, while \textipa{[u]} occurs elsewhere. \textipa{[u]} is likely to be less restricted, as it occurs in more environments than \textipa{[\r*u]}. 

      \item Yes; they do not occur in the same environment (complementary distribution): \textipa{[\r*i]} occurs only between voiceless consonants, while \textipa{[i]} occurs elsewhere. \textipa{[i]} is likely to be less restricted, as it occurs in more environments than \textipa{[\r*i]}. 
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Yes; they do not occur in the same environment (complementary distribution): \textipa{[z]} occurs only after nasals, while \textipa{[s]} occurs elsewhere. \textipa{[s]} is likely to be less restricted, as it occurs in more environments than \textipa{[z]}. 

  \item Yes; they do not occur in the same environment (complementary distribution): \textipa{[\textesh]} occurs only before certain vowels in the dataset, while \textipa{[s]} occurs elsewhere. \textipa{[s]} is likely to be less restricted, as it occurs in more environments than \textipa{[\textesh]}.

  \item No; even if they do not occur in the same environment in this dataset (complementary distribution), \textipa{[z]} and \textipa{[\textesh]} are not phonetically similar enough (different voicing and place).
